musically-linked-list
=====================

A JavaScript implementation of a musically linked list: a circular doubly-linked list composed of the twelve chromatic notes.

I am using the doubly linked list from Nicholas C. Zakas:
https://github.com/nzakas/computer-science-in-javascript/blob/master/data-structures/doubly-linked-list/doubly-linked-list.js 

and edited it to fit my circular, musical needs.

TODO: This whole readme.

I'm not sure if anyone has implemented this idea yet (it probably has been), but it was a fun exercise and feel free to use this for your own use, inspiration, or any other way you want. I will definitely continue working on this to add more functionality so if you want to make any contributions, please don't hesitate to let me know!
